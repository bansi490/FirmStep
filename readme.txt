Scenario

We have a council who would like to use an application to queue people at the reception

desk. The receptionist should be able to select the service (services also retrieve from database) and

take the customer details depending on the customer type:

• Citizen: title, first name and last name fields should be displayed

• Organisation: organisation name field should be visible

• Anonymous: no input fields should be visible

Customer would also like to see the currently queued people in a list.
